# Digital-Signal-Processing-Labs

In this course, we analyzed discrete-time signals and systems in time domain . Analyze discrete-time signals and systems in transform domain using z-Transform, DTFT, and DFT. Design various types of digital filters to meet given specifications. Apply appropriate digital signal processing techniques to an adequately-explained domain-specific scenarios.

The lab work mostly involved MATLAB and it's signal processing toolbox.
